# Beyond-One-to-One
Recovering missing links between issues and commits is essential for software traceability, maintenance, and evolution. While existing research has predominantly focused on one-to-one issue-commit relationships, real-world software development often follows a one-to-many pattern, where a single issue is resolved across multiple commits. This gap in research limits the effectiveness of automated link recovery methods and reduces their applicability in practical scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel large-scale dataset explicitly designed for one-to-many issue-commit link recovery, spanning four widely used programming languages: Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. Our dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark, capturing real-world issue resolution patterns that existing datasets fail to represent. We evaluate state-of-the-art models across different paradigms, including rule-based (FRLink), machine learning (HybridLinker), deep learning (DeepLink), and pre-trained transformers (EALink), establishing strong baselines for future research. Experimental results reveal that current approaches struggle with one-to-many relationships, highlighting the need for more advanced methods tailored to this challenge. We publicly release our dataset to encourage further research in automated issue-commit link recovery, aiming to bridge the gap between academic solutions and real-world software traceability needs.
