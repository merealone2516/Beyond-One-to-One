Running the Preprocessing Steps to Obtain the Final Dataset

To execute the preprocessing steps and generate the final dataset, you need to run the following scripts in the specified order:

    Step 1: Train_test_Split.py
        Run this script on the raw datasets provided in the Zenodo link to split the data into training and testing sets.

    Step 2: Splitting_True_False.py
        After completing Step 1, execute this script to separate the dataset into two files: one containing true links and the other containing false links.

    Step 3: Cleaning_and_preprocessing.py
        The two files obtained from Splitting_True_False.py will serve as input for this script, which performs data cleaning and preprocessing.

    Step 4: Removing_Nan.py
        The preprocessed files from Step 3 will be used as input for this script, which removes any missing values and ensures data consistency.

    Step 5: False_Link.py
        After running Removing_Nan.py, you will obtain two files. Only the False file needs to be used as input for False_Link.py.
        Save the output file generated by this script.

    Step 6: Final Processing
        The final dataset is created by combining:
            The True file obtained from Removing_Nan.py
            The False file generated from False_Link.py

By following these steps in order, you will obtain the fully processed dataset ready for further analysis.
