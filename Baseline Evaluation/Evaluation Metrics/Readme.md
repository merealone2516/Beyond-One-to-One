To evaluate the performance of the baseline models in recovering one-to-many issue-commit links, we use accuracy-based evaluation rather than traditional binary classification metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score. This approach aligns better with our one-to-many link recovery setting, where a single issue can be linked to multiple commits.
